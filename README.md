# My "Next" Site at [vinh.dev](https://vinh.dev)

## Tech stack

This blog is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) ([Preact](https://preactjs.com/) for production) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) using **Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog**.

A huge thanks to [Timothy Lin](https://twitter.com/timlrxx) for the minimal, lightweight, and super easy-to-customize blog starter and also to [Marcelo Forment√£o](https://twitter.com/marceloavf) for the customized theme design. This blog still uses a lot of components from Marcelo's and I can't say thank you enough to him for this to serve as a starting point for my own blog and for me to learn how to use Next.js.
